# Not So Brutal Company
A configurable hardcore mod for lethal company for me and my friends.

Feel free to add comments/suggestions here: https://github.com/bersekee/NotSoBrutalCompany/discussions

# Features
Increased and configurable difficulty, config file is located at (GAME_DIRECTORY/BepinEx/configs/NotSoBrutalCompany.cfg)

Random moon events ajusted to be more balanced.

Syncing to clients who dont have the mod

Removed the heat feature from brutal company.

# V1.3.0
- Added a config file to modify most of the internal values (quota, credit, enemies, etc...). Some event values are missing.
- Normally nothing else changed, however this went through minimal testing.

# V1.2.3
- Increased the maximum number of enemies during specific events Ex: More spiders during arachnophobia event. I will monitor the changes and try to balance it.
- Added a new event.

# V1.2.2
- Increased the overall difficulty and quota.
- Added passif credits.
